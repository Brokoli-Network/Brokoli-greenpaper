  Creating a deflationary system using our native blockchain based currency;
  $BRKL

# Token Economics

**$BRKL is an ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum Blockchain. $BRKL works through a complex deflationary system; a limited supply token that is used as in-world currency for trading ‘green assets’ & to reward successful gameplay and carbon offsetting.** \
\
The equilibrium of supply & demand is determined by the current circulating supply relative to the number of players succeeding at tournaments, winning minigames & the quantity of $BRKL being emitted vs. the number of players burning $BRKL through entering PvP competitions, travelling from habitat to habitat to planet, and gambling.

In conjunction with our deflationary economic system, a portion of all $BRKL & NFTs taken to be burnt/frozen and recirculated from any gameplay will be used to offset its carbon footprint as ‘green fees’.

$SEED is Brokoli Network’s secondary ERC-20 Native Token. $SEED is earned by using Brokoli Network’s Green DeFi products, and has real utility in the Green Metaverse. To further understand the use case of $SEED, please see “$SEED and NFTrees: Plant to Earn” below.

The greater the size of the Green Meta Community, the greater the prospects of decentralised governance as well as a self-regulating community that discourages bad actors, as well as manipulation of the governance and metaverse. \
\
Once the Green Metaverse is launched, users can stake $BRKL & $SEED as a signal of belief and support in the game and its governance model.
