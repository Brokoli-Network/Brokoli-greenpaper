# Climate Parliament DAO

**Through staking either of Brokoli Network’s native tokens ($BRKL or $SEED), a holder is afforded voting rights in the Climate Parliament DAO.** \
\
To mitigate any confusion, our Climate Parliament DAO is not a separate entity from BrokoliDAO. It instead refers to the functionality of BrokoliDAO that is dedicated solely to the collection of ‘green fees’ taken from Brokoli’s various products, and their subsequent allocation to fund Brokoli’s extensive board of vetted climate projects. \
\
**Staked holders will be afforded the ability to vote for which projects get funded, relative to the quantity of $BRKL or $SEED they have staked.**
