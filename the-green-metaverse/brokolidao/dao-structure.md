# DAO Structure

### The Green Metaverse plays off a tier-structured DAO system of governance.

It will have at its centre, one overarching DAO comprising:

a parliament that will govern how updates, gameplay developments and strategic partnerships will take place a treasury through which all cash flows into the Green Metaverse will be injected.

How much $BRKL a person has staked will determine their voting power and reward payout from DAO. The DAO will vote periodically on how its funds are used - whether that be paying out rewards to staked holders, or using them to fund exclusive events or experiences. \

**This generates an opportunity to earn passive income for users committed to managing the Green Metaverse, whilst disincentivizing any bad actors.**
