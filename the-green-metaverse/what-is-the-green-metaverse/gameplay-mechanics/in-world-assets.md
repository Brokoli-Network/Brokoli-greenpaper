# In-World Assets

### Sprouts: In-world pets that BROs can have as companions, each of which offers different perks in-world. BROs will have to trade $BRKL in-world for consumable assets to keep their sprouts well fed and watered.&#x20;

Failure to do this after a period of time will result in their sprout running away and returning to the wild (NFT is frozen).

**Consumables**: Consumable NFTs such as minigame boosts (i.e. banana peels to throw during moonracing), food for your sprout, and more, can be traded at the NFT Farmerâ€™s Market. Once used, these NFTs will be frozen and stored in the DAO Treasury to be recirculated & sold.

**Accessories**: Users will have access to a wide plethora of in-game accessories for their BROs, sprouts & treehouses. Some of these will be purely cosmetic, while others will boast special boosts like increased gameplay stats or increased yield for farming.

**Utility Assets**: Assets such as vehicles with higher stats for in-minigame usage will also be available for trading, both on our internal marketplace, as well as on third party trading platforms.
