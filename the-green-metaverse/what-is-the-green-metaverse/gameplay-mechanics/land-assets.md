# LAND Assets

### LAND are digital pieces of real-estate in the Green Metaverse. Owners of LAND can use the Brokoli SDK to build digital experiences and populate it with assets.

Each LAND is a unique, non-fungible token (NFT) ERC-721 Token. LAND will be auctioned off and sold as a fixed supply asset.

These LAND assets will offer investors unique earning potential, through a myriad of avenues:

Owners of LAND can build social experiences - hosting exclusive social events or showcasing art, music & entertainment. This will either offer the host the ability to sell off tickets to attend, or provide value for their Brokoli Tribe, thereby building utility for the subDAO and incentivizing users to join.

LAND owners can set up commerce on their LAND, offering goods and services to other users in exchange for other assets or native ERC20 tokens.

LAND owners can either advertise their own businesses, or rent their land to entities that do (either personally, or through hiring an external advertising service and negotiating profit share.)\

LAND owners can also choose to sublet their LAND to companies or individuals, in exchange for profit share of what income is generated on it - in doing so, this will allow the user to monetise their LAND if they themselves do not wish to operate it.

We will also allow the owner of the LAND the ability to assign smart contract or API calls to assets on their LAND, affording them unprecedented flexibility to interact with the internet and blockchain directly through their LAND, such as send telegram messages, check stock market prices, do contests or giveaways, add tokens to a liquidity pool, governance voting, staking, online shopping, live streaming and more.\
