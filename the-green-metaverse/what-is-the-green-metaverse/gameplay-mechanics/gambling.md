### 3rd party viewers will also have the opportunity to gamble and wager on PvP competitions, through our decentralized betting station.&#x20;

Users will be able to gamble and wager on their friends' performances, through leveraging any amount of $BRKL that they choose into a central pot.&#x20;

The winner(s) of the bet wins the total, subject to the amount of winners and divided according to how much that winner was willing to stake. Transaction fees will be set at 10% of the total wager, meaning that if you want to stake 100 BRKL, you must pay 110 BRKL total, 10 of which are divided between green fees and token burning.
