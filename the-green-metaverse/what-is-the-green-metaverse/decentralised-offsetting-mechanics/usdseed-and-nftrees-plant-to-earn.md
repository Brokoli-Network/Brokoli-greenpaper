# $SEED and NFTrees: Plant to Earn

### The ultimate aim of our Green Metaverse is to incentivize people to go green whilst exploring everything Web3 has to offer. We are therefore rewarding newcomers to use our green defi products by offering income-earning opportunities.

Through using our various green defi products, such as our DEX Aggregator, users will earn our native ERC-20 $SEED token. Through our Climate Dashboard, users will be able to plant their $SEED in exchange for NFTrees (An ERC-721 native token).&#x20;

The value of $SEED will be set proportionally to the mint price of our LAND assets. Once in their wallet, users will be able to sell NFTrees, either on our in-world NFT Marketplace or on a 3rd party marketplace. Or alternatively, they will be able to use it to help grow the value of their LAND asset, should they hold one.&#x20;

NFTrees can be attached to a user’s LAND smart contract, thereby growing a tree on it, which equates to more surface area to delegate, build commerce on, rent as green advertising space, or simply build and customise your own bespoke NFTreehouse.&#x20;

The more NFTrees you attach to your LAND smart contract, the higher your tree will grow vertically, and the more earning potential you will have.

A user’s capacity to plant NFTrees will be limited depending on the amount of LAND they hold. LAND assets are not fixed to coordinates.&#x20;

This means that planting NFTrees, will be directly proportional to the value of your LAND asset.

Using this system, we are able to keep our LAND assets at a fixed supply, whilst incentivising use of our green defi products (which will be directly proportional to the appreciation of LAND assets on the open market).

### **Portion of $BRKL burnt is actually used to plant trees**

**In conjunction with our deflationary economic system, a portion of all $BRKL & NFTs taken to be burnt/frozen and recirculated from any given transaction or minigame loss will be used to plant enough trees to offset its carbon footprint.**
