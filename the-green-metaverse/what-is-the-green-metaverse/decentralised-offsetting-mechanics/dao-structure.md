# DAO Structure

### The Green Metaverse plays off a tier-structured DAO system of governance.

It will have at its centre, one overarching DAO comprising:

a parliament that will govern how updates, gameplay developments and strategic partnerships will take place a treasury through which all cash flows into the Green Metaverse will be injected.

**BRO Tribes**: Our world boasts 5 rival tribes, all battling to top the global leaderboard for fame, fortune and glory.&#x20;

These will each serve as subDAOs, a democratically governed council of active community members, who use their relative portion of $BRKL staked as shares in deciding fundamental futures of both the clan and the metaverse as a whole.&#x20;

Depending on the amount of $BRKL currently in circulation, how much $BRKL a clan member owns will determine their rank on the clan’s high council (and subsequent voting power and passive earning potential), with one high counsellor acting as chieftain of the clan.&#x20;

Different ranks will yield special NFTs, as well as larger governance rights. These subDAOs will be interlinked with the main metaverse DAO.

Each tribe also houses their own treasury, which will take a small percentage fee of any rewards or victories their disciples earn. The Tribes governance parliament, or ‘council’, will vote periodically on how the funds of its are used. This generates an opportunity to earn passive income for users committed to managing the Green Metaverse, disincentivizing any bad actors bringing us one step closer to the world’s first fully decentralised Green Metaverse.

### The 5 tribes reflect 5 of the key features of our planet - Forest, River, Mountain, Sky & Desert.

After a new BRO has been properly inducted into the Green Metaverse, they will have the ability to roam and explore the world freely. At any point they can head over to the HQ of any one of the 5 tribes, and pledge their fealty to said tribe. This allows tribes to reward members $BRKL to contribute to and grow their organisation; whether that be through head hunting new recruits, holding events, or organising in-world partnerships with real world figures and brands; all payable out of the clan DAO treasury.

By actively contributing to and aiding your tribe to metaverse supremacy, you will be rewarded with unique assets, power-ups & airdrops.

While 5 clans govern the Green Metaverse, only one can be champion. A leaderboard of the clan’s net rewards yielded will determine who ranks highest in the metaverse.&#x20;

This clan will be entitled to unique asset drop and enhanced yield, all to be deposited into their individual treasury.&#x20;

Tournaments & in-world competitions will be held to pit clans head to head, with individuals from each clan competing against each other.

Failure to participate in the active growth of your clan as a council member will result in the eventual removal of a user's position, and subsequent earning & governance rights.\

After a full council term, members will have the ability to reshuffle the council arrangement, following a majority vote. Votes will be organised proportionally to the quantity of $BRKL staked by individuals, which rank them in-tribe accordingly.
