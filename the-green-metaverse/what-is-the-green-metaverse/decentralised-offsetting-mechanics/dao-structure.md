# DAO Structure

**The Green Metaverse plays off a tier-structured DAO system of governance.**

It will have at its centre, one overarching DAO comprising:

a parliament that will govern how updates, gameplay developments and strategic partnerships will take place a treasury through which all cash flows into the Green Metaverse will be injected.

BRO Tribes: Our world boasts 5 rival tribes, all battling to top the global leaderboard for fame, fortune and glory. These will each serve as subDAOs, a democratically governed council of active community members, who use their relative portion of $BRKL staked as shares in deciding the fundamental future of both the tribe and the metaverse as a whole. How much $BRKL a tribe member has staked will determine their rank on the clan’s high council, and subsequent voting power and passive earning potential. Different ranks will yield special NFTs, as well as larger governance rights. These subDAOs will be interlinked with the main metaverse DAO.

Each tribe also houses their own treasury, which will take a small percentage fee of any rewards or victories their tribesmen earn. The tribe’s governance parliament, or ‘council’, will vote periodically on how its funds are used - whether that be paying out dividends, or using them to fund exclusive events or experiences for its members. This generates an opportunity to earn passive income for users committed to managing the Green Metaverse, whilst disincentivizing any bad actors.

The 5 tribes reflect 5 of the key features of our planet - Forest, River, Mountain, Sky & Desert.

After a new BRO has been properly inducted into the Green Metaverse, they will have the ability to roam and explore the world freely. At any point they can join any one of these 5 tribes. This incentivises tribes to reward their members to contribute to and grow their organisation by head hunting new recruits - whether that be through holding events, organising sponsorship deals with real world figures and brands etc.

While 5 tribes comprise the Green Metaverse, only one can be champion. A leaderboard of all the tribes will determine who ranks highest in the metaverse. This tribe will be entitled to rewards including unique asset drops and more.

Failure to participate in the active growth of your tribe as a council member will result in the eventual removal of a user's position, and subsequent earning & governance rights. After a full council term, members will have the ability to reshuffle the council arrangement, following a majority vote.
