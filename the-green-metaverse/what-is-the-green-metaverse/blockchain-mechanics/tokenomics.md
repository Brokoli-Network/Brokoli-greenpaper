### Blockchain based currencies: $BRKL & $SEED; and creating a deflationary system through burn stakes pvp and pve challenges

$BRKL is an ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum Blockchain. $BRKL works through a complex deflationary system; a limited supply token that is used as in-world currency for trading ‘green assets’ & to reward successful gameplay and carbon offsetting. The equilibrium of supply & demand is determined by the current circulating supply relative to the number of players succeeding at tournaments, winning minigames & the quantity of $BRKL being emitted vs. the number of players burning $BRKL through ‘green fees’ spent through entering PvP competitions, travelling from habitat to habitat to planet, and gambling.

The greater the size of the Green Meta Community, the greater the prospects of decentralised governance as well as a self-regulating community that discourages bad actors, as well as manipulation of the governance and metaverse. Once the Green Metaverse is launched, users can stake $BRKL as a signal of belief and support in the game and its governance model.
