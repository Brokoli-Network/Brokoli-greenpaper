# Tokenomics

**Creating a deflationary system using our native blockchain based currency:  $BRKL**

$BRKL is an ERC-20 Token on the Ethereum Blockchain. $BRKL works through a complex deflationary system; a limited supply token that is used as in-world currency for trading ‘green assets’ & to reward successful gameplay and carbon offsetting. The equilibrium of supply & demand is determined by the current circulating supply relative to the number of players succeeding at tournaments, winning minigames & the quantity of $BRKL being emitted vs. the number of players burning $BRKL through entering PvP competitions, travelling from habitat to habitat to planet, and gambling.

In conjunction with our deflationary economic system, a portion of all $BRKL & NFTs taken to be burnt/frozen and recirculated from any gameplay will be used to offset its carbon footprint as ‘green fees’.

The greater the size of the Green Meta Community, the greater the prospects of decentralised governance as well as a self-regulating community that discourages bad actors, as well as manipulation of the governance and metaverse. **Once the Green Metaverse is launched, users can stake $BRKL as a signal of belief and support in the game and its governance model.**
