# PvP Gambling

Users will be able to gamble and wager on PvP competitions, leveraging $BRKL into a central betting pot. The winner(s) of the bet will win the total pot, relative to the amount of winners and divided according to how much $BRKL each winner was willing to stake. \
\
Transaction fees will be set at 5% of the total wager (which will be divided between ‘green fees’ and token burning)
