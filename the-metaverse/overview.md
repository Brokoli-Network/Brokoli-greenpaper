# Overview

Enter the BRO Club. To enter, you’ll need a key. **Your BRO is your key.** And while all BROs are equal, some BROs are more equal than others, so choose yours wisely.

The BRO Club will act as a tokenized, decentralized forum of socialisation for Web 3.0, with $BRKL at its core. In this world, you build status based on your positive impact -- the amount of NFTrees that you hold. To get NFTrees, you can:

i) use Brokoli’s products to plant trees&#x20;

ii) buy the trees of other players

#### The BRO Club serves the $BRKL community in the following ways:

1\) Socialise&#x20;

2\) Advertise&#x20;

3\) Earn&#x20;

4\) Play

Heavily inspired by the success of Club Penguin, we aim to recreate that spirit in the blockchain world, attracting millions of users.
