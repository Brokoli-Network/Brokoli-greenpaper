# 3. Our Vision

Echoing the goals outlined by the Paris Agreement, we strive to achieve net zero carbon emissions in blockchain. We will make **climate action to eventually be part of every DeFi transaction.**

However, the reality is different: [this recent Harvard study](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37365412/MARTYNOV-DOCUMENT-2020.pdf?sequence=1) illustrates how each $1 of cryptocurrency coin value created would be responsible for $0.66 in health and climate damages. While currently blockchain is operating against the global realisation to adopt greener practices across all economic sectors, we want digital currencies to be a part of the sustainable future: climate and planet positive future, not self-destructive future.&#x20;

We see that DeFi applications are improving the inefficiencies of the financial world. This is why weâ€™re building a non-custodial solution to offset the carbon footprint caused by digital transactions every day. As a result, we will implement decentralisation in the decision-making process of how the carbon emission offset.

### **We are taking the green revolution on the blockchain.**&#x20;

### **Our vision: becoming the ultimate sustainability standard in blockchain: no project will be taken seriously without Brokoli's climate-positivity badge.** ****
