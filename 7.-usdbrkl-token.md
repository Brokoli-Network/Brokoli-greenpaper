# 7. $BRKL Token

With the $BRKL token, Brokoli Network will be governed by a decentralized autonomous organization \(DAO\). With that, token holders will be able to cast their vote to decide the choice of renewable energy projects, e-waste collection and recycling programmes, and partners for planting trees. 

On top of that, we will introduce instant governance: a new kind of governance where the community can participate, benefit and vote for specific protocol settings without any barrier to entry. This will make the Brokoli Network fully community governed, efficient, user-friendly and transparent, where members can propose changes to how our system works. The community will be carried out using [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org): an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

Brokoli will receive Climate Fees from Brokoli DEX, direct donations from companies and individuals, and API-collected Climate Fees in native tokens. Native tokens are then used to buy $BRKL tokens and distributed to $BRKL token holders that stake and participate in the community vote. 

While Liquidity providers will earn 4% of Climate Fee as rewards in the form of $BRKL tokens, holders that participate in the vote will earn 1% of Climate Fee. This means that even if liquidity providers no longer participate in liquidity provision but continue to hold $BRKL, they will be entitled to a reward. The earnings that holders and liquidity providers receive will be proportional to the amount of $BRKL tokens staked versus the total amount of the $BRKL tokens staked. 

Those that are providing liquidity for $BRKL will have a chance to choose whether they would like to receive their tokens as a reward or donate that reward to plant trees. Consequently, people that stake our token may choose to receive their reward in trees planted.
